        <img src="images/andrea.jpg"/>
        <p> I first experienced the wonders of the African continent in 1980 as a gap year before studying at University. I quickly fell in love with the multitude of landscapes and peoples that make this region there home. I stayed in Africa for a few years exploring its vast regions. Once returning I decided that I wanted to create oppurtunites for others to be transfixed by the magic of Africa.</p>
    <p>I studied African History and Tourism Management at the University of Queensland before starting Kiboko with my new husband. I organise and plan all the general trip outlines and come up with ideas for new trips. I work out of the Brisbane Office</p></section>

I continue my adventures to this day and have an enduring passion for the region. </p><p>In my role as Tours Co-ordinator I manage the logistics and details for all our tours.

    <p>I was born in and have lived in South Africa for most of my life. I love the country and its neighbours. Although I haven't experienced much of the adventurous side of Southern Africa, I am familiar with many of the more peaceful ways to holiday in this area.</p>
    <p>I organise all of the specials from the logistics to discussions with customers. I aim to ensure all our customers get to experience the perfect African holiday for them. I am based in the Brisbane office.</p></section>
    <section><h2>Ben Cumpston - Tours Consultant</h2><p>I was born in and have lived in Kenya for most of my life. I was lucky enough to get a chance to thoroughly explore this majestic continent throughout my childhood. I am passionate about preserving the indigenous cultures and allowing outsiders to appreciate them.</p>
    <p>I am the key point of contact between customers and the company before the trip for those who wish to go on our tours. I focus on making sure they have the best experience possible in there trip through Africa. I work from our Kenyan office.</p></section>
