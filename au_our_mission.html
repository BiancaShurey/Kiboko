    <h1> Our Mission </h1>
        <blockquote>Allowing travellers to experience all Africa has to offer while assisting African indigenous Communities.</blockquote>
        <p>Andrea Svenn fell in love with Africa in the early 80s. She travelled all over the continent and lived with a variety of African communities. When she returned to Australia she decided to help others share in similar adventures. She set up Kiboko with her husband Mark in 1986 and has never looked back.</p>
        <p> Kiboko is the Swahili word for hippopotamus. In Zulu culture hippos are considered to be the most courageous animal, even braver than a lion. They are also  considered to be a protector particularly of women and children.</p>
        <p>Kiboko is an African travel agency that focus on allowing users to explore all Africa has to offer. We have been focusing on this since 1986 and work closely with our African drivers and tour guides. We are a family owned business and aim to ensure that all travellers experience the complex beauty of the African continent . All of our consultants have extensive African travel experience and a passion for the region. </p>
