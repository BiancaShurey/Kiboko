	<blockquote>“In 2010 we had the adventure holiday of a lifetime – well, hopefully not the last time we go to Africa with Kiboko. From our first meeting, which built our excitement at the thought of a dream come true, to the eventuality – an amazing couple of weeks, immersing ourselves in the culture and animal kingdom of Africa, we could not have hoped for more! The reality of famous places like Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, Kilimanjaro, was not disappointing! Under the guidance of Robert, and the gracious African driver/guides and ground crew, we covered much ground, met interesting people, shared fun times, ate good food, slept in wonderful accommodation, and never tired of seeing the wonders of the African animal kingdom. The Wildebeest Migration was a never-to-be-forgotten experience – the surging wave of beasts, hurled themselves into the river, literally at our feet, as we inhaled their swirling dust! We were left with a wonderful taste of Africa, and an appetite for more! Recommend this as No1 on your bucket list! </blockquote>
	<blockquote>We have been meaning to contact you since we got back to thank you, and Kiboko, for organising the trip. We had a great time and everything went very smoothly (albeit in an African way sometimes). We became aware of the knowledge and expertise that went into designing our trip as it unfolded and sent silent thanks to you many times!  All the accommodation was good and the guides were great.  While we had worried that we might have committed to too many game drives in sequence before we left, in fact it was perfect because the animals behaved differently in each environment and we were able to pick our guides brains for more in depth knowledge. We thought that Georgia in the Masai Mara and John in Tanzania were particularly good. Not sure how much it was luck and how much the guides but we saw a leopard in a tree with a wildebeest kill, lions devouring a recently killed zebra, lions mating, young lion cubs, lions with a recently killed buffalo, a three day old giraffe (as well as many beautiful adults), a baby elephant - not as used to cars and humans as the adults - who tried to chase us away but when we didn't move ran back to mum for some milk, a cheetah up close and lots more.  Breezes in Zanzibar was a great wind down venue after all the Safari "work".

<blockquote>With family members flying from and then onwards to various parts of the world, our 6 person, 4 country, 4 week long African trip of a lifetime could have been a logistical nightmare. However Andrea organized it so well that it all went perfectly. We lunched with whales in Hermanus, scaled Table Mountain in perfect sunshine, saw all manner of "fives" on safari in Sabi Sands and Botswana, bungee jumped and zip-lined in Vic Falls, swam with dolphins in Mozambique, always staying in marvelous accommodation and eating delicious food everywhere. We had the most wonderful holiday, the best 60th birthday present for my husband. It fact it all went so well that our son and his girlfriend got engaged on Ibo Island in Mozambique on our second last day! Thank you so much for all you did to make our trip so special.
