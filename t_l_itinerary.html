If watching isn't enough, when the water levels are low, take a swim at the Devil’s Pool at the edge of the falls, or at Angel’s Armchair. The falls are visible from 48.2km (30 mi) away.</p>

<h3>Day 23</h3>

<h3>Livingstone/Lusaka 
</h3>

<p>Sit back and enjoy a day of driving, taking in the scenery.</p>

<p>Set off early, around 6am, and arrive late in the afternoon. The long journey across rough and bumpy roads takes us to a private game farm 29km (18 mi) outside of the capital of Zambia. Marvel at the zebras, buffalo, and the bok that roam the property, or relax by the pool or at the camp’s bar.</p>

<p>This is an overnight stop in between two long driving days, so we will not have time to explore Lusaka.</p>

<h3>Day 25</h3>

<h3>Chipata/Kande Beach 
</h3>

<p>Travel to the "Lake of Stars," Lake Malawi.</p>

<p>Spend four nights relaxing on the shores of the “Lake of Stars”. Beach walks, swimming in the crystal clear water, and snorkelling among the tropical fish are all part and parcel of your stay.</p>

<p>Lake Malawi is known for good snorkelling and diving. The locals depend on the lake for fishing and survival, and use dugout canoes to fish from and set out long nets. There are many different ethnic groups, all speaking their own language; most are Christians and the rest have traditional beliefs.</p>

<p>The currency in Malawi is Malawian Kwacha (MWK). Most establishments and operators do accept USD for payment, but because banks are often far away, the exchange rate is not favourable. It is better to pay in local currency as much as possible.</p>

<p>Please note that conservative dress is recommended. Shoulders and knees should be covered in public, but inside of camp boundaries, it is ok to wear beach clothes.</p>

<p>Hop on a ferry and explore Stone Town on the island of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>After arriving on Zanzibar, spend the remainder of the day exploring Stone Town, the heart of the island. It has an intriguing maze of narrow, cobbled lanes hemmed in by Arabic buildings. Look out for tinga-tinga paintings, antique shops, beautifully printed cloths (kangas and kikois worn by local people), little carved chests with copper inlays, and spices – all beautiful presents or souvenirs to take home.</p>

<p>Zanzibar is a Muslim society. Immodestly dressed women or men in shorts will get harassed and cause great offense in Stone Town. In Nungwi, customs are a little more relaxed, but our travellers are encouraged to be respectful of the island's culture and still cover up when walking around. Never try to take a photograph without asking permission.</p>
