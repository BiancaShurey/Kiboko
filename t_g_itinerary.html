    <h5>DAY 1</h5>
<h4>Arrive in the Mother City</h4>

<p>Your African family holiday begins today as you arrive in beautiful Cape Town and collect your rental car from Cape Town International Airport. From here you'll make your way to the More Quarters Apartments.  This historic building is situated in the heart of Cape Town and offers an ideal place from which to explore the city. Unwind with a treatment at the spa, relax in your spacious rooms or set out to discover the Mother City with your family.</p>

<h5>DAYS 2-4</h5>
<h4>Discover Cape Town</h4>

<p>On your arrival at Cape Town International Airport collect your hire-car and drive to More Quarters Apartments, which is situated on trendy Kloof Street in the heart of the Cape Town. Your apartment is located in a historic building that combines bohemian interiors with refined sophistication and modern convenience. Embracing innovation while paying homage to history, your lock-up-and-go single apartment provides the perfect base from which to discover Africa&rsquo;s favourite city. Live like a local while still enjoying the full service support of a luxury hotel. On your doorstep are world-class restaurants, buzzing sidewalk caf&eacute;s, boutiques and art galleries while the pristine beaches of Camps Bay and Clifton are just a short drive away.</p>
<p>Spend your time in Cape Town wandering the chic streets surrounding your apartment and visiting some of this dynamic city&rsquo;s major attractions. The V&amp;A Waterfront is a shopping and entertainment hub from where you can also take a ferry to Robben Island for a guided tour of the late Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s prison cell. Visit a handful of Constantia estates that form part of the Cape Winelands for tastings and finish off the experience with a lavish lunch at a restaurant overlooking the vineyards set against the stunning backdrop of iconic Table Mountain. Hundreds of endangered African penguins can be spotted on Boulders Beach with the opportunity to enjoy a tour of the stunning Cape Peninsula on your way there.</p>
<p>Each evening freshen up before heading out into the city for dinner. Visit swanky tapas bars and cocktail lounges or you might prefer the white linen and silver-service dining on offer at more formal eateries. Perhaps something very relaxed like a South African boerewors roll washed down an ice-cold local craft beer is more your thing!</p>

<h5>DAYS 5-7</h5>
<h4>Let the bush take your breath away</h4>
<p>It doesn't get much better than a Kruger Park safari. Home to the widest diversity of wildlife in South Africa and delivering some of the finest game viewing on the continent, the Kruger offers international award-winning accommodation, smooth-running logistics and some of Africa's best trackers and guides, ready to take you on Big 5 game drives and big-thrill walking safaris.</p>

<h5>DAY 8</h5>
<h4>A night in the city</h4>

<p>Internationally renowned Sun City is South Africa's unrivalled number one holiday resort, delivering non-stop, big-thrill entertainment every day of the year. If you're looking for an uncomplicated, multi-faceted vacation in a sunny, safe and ever-smiling environment, then a Sun City holiday is hard to beat.</p>

<p>Hyperbole? Hardly. It's no understatement to say that malaria-free Sun City delivers the widest range of holiday activities in Africa: tee off on one of the two Gary Player-designed championship golf courses; grab a swim at the outrageous Valley of the Waves or look for the Big 5 in the excellent Pilanesberg National Park just next door. But don't think it stops there: at night Sun City transforms into a glitzy hub of restaurants, cocktail bars, casinos and spectacular live shows - you're not going to be stuck for things to do at Sun City.</p>

<p>No prizes then for guessing that a holiday at Sun City is perfect for active parents with even more active children, golfers who want a safari edge to their game and for those who want a don't-make-me-think vacation complete with impeccable service and first-class accommodation - and what accommodation there is! With options ranging from family-friendly hotels to the glitzy indulgence of the 5-Star Palace of the Lost City, you'll be spoilt for choice.</p>

<h5>DAYS 9-13</h5>
<h4>Bliss on Bazaruto</h4>

<p>Mozambique stretches some 2 500km along the east coast of Africa; scattered off its southern shores is the Bazaruto Archipelago, a glittering cluster of five tropical islands. Benguerra and Bazaruto are the two largest islands in the archipelago. Both are fringed by golden beaches and an impossibly blue sea, and each offers luxurious, stress-busting accommodation where you can easily spend a week winding down to the slow rhythm of island life: swim, snorkel, eat and sleep - and why not enjoy a massage or spa treatment while you're at it.</p>

<p>For those with energy to burn however, a Bazaruto Island holiday offers fantastic activities. In the 1970s, the Bazaruto National Park was created to protect the local marine life and today Two Mile Reef has become world renowned for its scuba-diving and snorkelling while giant trevally, sailfish and marlin are regularly reeled in on deep-sea fishing excursions.</p>
<h5>DAY 14</h5>
<h4>Au Revoir Africa</h4>

<p>Bid farewell to tropical Indigo Bay today as you catch your charter flight back to Vilanculos. From here you'll board your return flight to Johannesburg whereupon this memorable tour will come to an end.</p>
