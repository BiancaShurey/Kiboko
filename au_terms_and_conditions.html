    <h1>Booking Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <h2>Bookings</h2>
    <p>Once we have recived the inital from we will be in contact with you regarding the details of the process. A deposit will be part of these discussions.</p>
    <h2>Tour Payments</h2>
    <p>On receipt of deposit, we will send a booking confirmation letter. The balance of payment is due approx. 90 days prior to tour departure. On occasion it may be necessary for us to request balance of payment earlier due to requirements from tour service providers.</p>
    <h2>Change of cost and itinerary</h2>
<p>We will make every effort to avoid changes to the tour costs and itineraries. Each tour cost is based on exchange rates, fares and tariffs applicable at the time of publication. The actual tour costs will depend on exchange rates and tariffs applicable at the time the bookings are paid for by us. Therefore costs may be subject to change. All tours need a minimum number of guests to operate at the prices listed in the itinerary. If the minimum number is not reached, a tour may still operate with a surcharge. From time to time we may be required to modify the itinerary due to changes to accommodation, local tours, transport, walking conditions or weather. If such modifications are required, this is done so with your needs in mind and to provide the best tour experience. We will provide you with as much notice as possible for itinerary changes and in some instances, such modifications may be subject to an additional cost.</p>
<h2>Cancellations</h2>
<p>Should you decide to cancel your tour, you must notify Kiboko immediately in writing. Cancellation takes place as soon as we receive your written notification. Please note: if your tour invoice has been issued and you cancel before payment is made, you are still bound by our terms and conditions. The following cancellation fees and time lines will apply:</p>
<p>We accept cancellations up to 30 days prior to the departure. If they cancel after that day, we  charge 50% of their trip or 100% of their package in case of Specials.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may be required or it may be necessary to cancel the tour and we will provide you with as much notice as is reasonably possible in such circumstances. If we cancel due to not reaching minimum numbers, then your deposit will be immediately refunded to you in full or you may elect to transfer the deposit to another tour. If we cancel a tour due to tour safety, for example in the event of a natural disaster, we will refund as much of your tour payment as we are able to recoup from the operators. Any non-refundable costs you incur may be subject to Travel Insurance claims.</p>
<h2>Travel Insurance</h2>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory and is included in the price of the trips unless stated otherwise.</p>
<h2>Age, Health and Fitness</h2>
<p>You may require vaccinations for certain trips. If this is the case it will be communicated to you in advance and it is your responsibility to organise and pay for these.</p>
<p>We cannot accept bookings from unaccompanied minors or those who cannot travel independently. While we do not have an upper age limit or fitness level, our walks are often in remote locations and you must be certain you are capable of fully participating in the tour activities as noted in the itinerary. Travellers should be in good health and have an appropriate level of fitness. In preparation for your tour, you should be undertaking walks similar to those described in the itinerary. A Medical Questionnaire must be completed prior to the tour departure. Disclosure of your known medical history and conditions is vital, as these may seriously impact the tour. If you have a medical condition, you will be asked to seek your doctor's consent to participate on the tour. Kiboko reserves the right in its absolute discretion to refuse a traveller the right to participate in a tour on medical or fitness grounds. All medical details will be treated as confidential.</p>

We are not liable to you for any injury, loss, damage, accident, delay or irregularity which may be caused by any acts or defaults of any third persons or organisations responsible for carrying out any of the arrangements of the tour. The travel and / or accommodation and other similar contracts in use by these operators constitute the sole contract between them and you.

Kiboko reserves the right to use these images and this feedback for promotional purposes, unless otherwise notified by you to us in writing.</p>
<h2>Tour leaders and guides</h2>
<p>An experienced tour leader will accompany your tour group. Local guides may assist with different aspects of a tour. Our tour leaders and guides are mindful of each traveller's welfare however they cannot ensure the personal safety of travellers. At all times you must exercise care for your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of others accompanying you.</p>
<h2>15. Waiver and release</h2>
